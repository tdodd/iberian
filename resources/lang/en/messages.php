    'blurb1' => 'The Iberian Diaspora Database, hosted by the Faculty of Arts at the University of Ottawa (Canada) is a digital resource, which serves as as a tool for the study of the migrations, over several generations, of descendants of Jews and Muslims who had to leave the Iberian Peninsula in the early modern period. It covers a period between 1500 and 1800, three centuries during which generations of descendants of converted Jews and Muslim left Spain and Portugal because of the suspicions against them as descendants of people who had converted to the Catholic faith.',

    'blurb2' => 'The sources for the data are multiple: Inquisitorial trials, notarial documents, records of ships, diplomatic correspondence and letters of exchange in several archives. Through this resource it will be possible to reconstruct the routes of individuals and families, study their places of departure and destination and their descendants. The entries in the database allow for searches with multiple criteria (place of birth, arrival and death along their respective dates, profession or trade and relationships) and point out the archival or bibliographical sources from which the data originated. The database will be continuously expanded and enriched in collaboration with the Laboratorio de Estudios Judeoconversos at the University of Cordoba. Current collaborators are Rafael GirÃ³n Pascual, Roberto Fiorentini and Ricardo Camarena Castellanos. Thanks must be given to the generosity of the Faculty of Arts which supported this initiative.',
